# Project Proposal Draft Submission

## What will the project do?
The project will be a web application that allows users to enter doi (permalinks) to research articles and converse in a chat room with other users about the article.

## What problem does it solve?
This project solves the problem where researchers have a hard time finding resources and discussions about specific research articles. Often, the only way to find this information is through social media or other forums, which can be difficult to find information relevant to the exact article they are looking for.

## What is the target audience for your program?
The target audience is researchers, students, and other academics who are looking for a way to discuss specific research articles.

## What technology will you use to create, manage, and complete the project?
We will use Node.js with Express for the backend and a static frontend. We will use a database (yet to be determined specifics) to store information and discussions.

## Have you already thought of classmates you would like in your project group?
Yes, the following are the classmates participating in this project:
- Iurii Chmykhun
- Joshua Ganschow (myself)
- Nathaniel Ketema
- John McMahon

## What challenges do you foresee with your chosen project?
- Learning the necessary technologies to complete the project.
- Synchronization (webhooks)
- Moderation of content
- Export controls
