# CSC470/570 Project

A discussion board for researchers, observers, and curious minds that focuses on DOI articles.

Currently hosted on a server accessible on `https://470.iurii.io` (Is it down? Message owners of this repo!)

## About This Project
Our proposal can be found in [project-proposal-draft.md](./docs/project-proposal-draft.md)

This project is hosted on a Google Cloud VM on an almost-free-tier. Our idea is to help researchers collaborate and discuss articles they've found interesting.
